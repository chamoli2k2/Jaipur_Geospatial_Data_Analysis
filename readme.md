# Jaipur District and Village Level Census Data Visualization

## Project Overview
The **Jaipur District and Village Level Census Data Visualization** project aims to provide an in-depth exploration of census data from Jaipur, India, at both district and village levels. By leveraging modern web technologies and geospatial mapping techniques, the project creates an interactive dashboard that presents complex demographic data in a visually appealing and easily understandable manner.

### Key Objectives:
- **Data Accessibility**: Making census data accessible and understandable to a wider audience, including policymakers, researchers, and the general public.
- **Visual Insights**: Providing intuitive visualizations that allow users to explore demographic trends, population distribution, and other significant metrics.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Enabling users to interact with data through maps and charts, facilitating a deeper understanding of the socio-economic landscape of Jaipur.

### Implementation
The project is built using a combination of frontend and backend technologies:

- **Frontend**: Developed with **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a responsive and modern user interface. The frontend includes components for visualizing data using libraries like **Chart.js** and **Leaflet** for mapping.
  
- **Backend**: The backend is implemented using **Flask**, a lightweight Python web framework. It handles data processing and serves API endpoints that the frontend consumes to display dynamic data visualizations.
  
- **Data Handling**: Census data is processed and stored in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and is served to the frontend through RESTful API calls. The project utilizes geospatial libraries for accurate mapping and representation of data.

## Findings (Under Construction)
> **Note**: This section is currently under construction. We aim to provide detailed analyses and insights derived from the census data, including but not limited to:
> - Population demographics and trends over the years.
> - Comparison of various socio-economic indicators at district and village levels.
> - Insights into the distribution of resources and infrastructure.
